# nba_home-records

This project was developed to improve my skills in data analysis using the Python library pandas. The main objective was to apply various data manipulation and cleaning techniques on a dataset of customer orders from a hypothetical e-commerce platform. Through the use of pandas, I was able to analyze the data and gain insights into customer behavior and order patterns.
